Computer-Electronic device.
Takes input and gives output
Any information can be encoded as sequence of 0 and 1.

Data is a binary sequence which is associated with the values based on 
positional weights.
Basic units of measurements-:
BIT is a unit of information equivalent to the result of a choice b/w only
two possible alternativesin the binary number system.(0 or 1)

Hardware-->Tangible(Physical)
Track02.mp3 and DSC1.jpg these are some files which you see generally,
here .mp3 and .jpg are file extensions and Track02 and DSC1 are file name.
sum.exe->computer ko kya karna hai ye .exe file me likha hota hai.
    (.exe)Executable software
Software-(a)Application  (user ke matlab ka Ex-MS Word)
         (b)System       (machine le matlab ka hote hai Ex-device driver)

Program-set of indtructions.
Process-active state of program.(kisi program ko run krte waqt)
Source code-codes that are written by a programmer.
Operating system-It provides interface between user and machine.
                 It does process,mangement,memory etc.

                               Memory unit(MU)            [Jab bhi koi program

MU-set of registors.
CU-circuit that reads instructions and decodes it.
ALU-responsible for all arithmetic and logical unit.

Software devlopment in C-:                                [.exe file O.S dependent hota

Compiler-program that processes statements into machine readable language.
       
Header files-It is the file(text) where all the header files with extension .h are mentioned,
  and it contains the link to libraries.
Library files-It is the file where the implementation of code of each header is written down 
 which is mentioned in the header file.It contains all pre defined funtion and methods.
A  compiler recognizes the standard function used in code via preprocessor that resolves all
the directives.(directives are the lines in program preceeded by #sign that include)

Identifiers-:
Constants,variables,keywords.
Instructions-:
(1)Data type declaration instruction
(2)Input/output instruction
(3)Arithmetic instruction
(4)Control instruction         {controls the sequence of code execution}

Constant-->Any information
 |  Data=information=constant(also known as literals)
 |
 |-->(1)Priamary                 (2)Secondary

       Integer                     Array
       Real                        String(It is written b/w " ")
       Character(Ex-'a',           Pointer
           single quote            Union   
            zaroori hai)           Structure
                                   Enumerator
Variables-->memory me us jagah ka name jaha hum data rkhenge/rkhte hai,also known as 
identifiers.Name kbhi bhi number se start nhi hoga and _iske alawa koi bhi symbol use 
nhi krenge.
Variables + constant are called operands.

Keywords-->Reserved words
There are 32 keywords in C.
auto,break,case,char,continue,do,default,const,double,else,enum,entern,for,if,goto,float,
long,register,return,signed,static,size of,short,typedef,union,void,while,volatile,unsigned.

Pre-defined functions-These are some stansard functions provided in c libraries to perform basic
work.Ex-printf(" ")prints something you write b/w " ".
        scanf(" ",& )stores/assigns the value you give/input
        getch()waits to get a character
        clrsc()clears screen

Data type-int,float,double,char etc.
Comments-Lines which dont compile.
    // use for single line comment 
    /*   */use for multiple lines.
Escape sequence(\n)-Uses for changing line.
Format specifier-ye apni jagah par variable ka value print ya store krta hai.
      %d-int
      %f-float
      %c-char
      %lf-double
; semicolon indicates the end of statements.
Whenever we declare a variable and dont assign anything to it.It automatically stores
a garbage value.Ex--int a,b=; so here a will store store a random value/garbage value.

so lets end theory.
//First program every coder writes(Hello world)

   #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
     {
     printf("Hello World");
     return 0;
     }

so let me explain everything happening here #include<stdio.h> is a library file called standard 
input output in which function like printf,scanf are defined. int main() is also a function in
which the code is written without it the code will compile but not execute.As we know printf
prints anything and return 0 basically means that code is compiled successfully.
